                <p>My name is Marc Garde and I am currently a student at San
                    Francisco State University.  I like hanging out with my friends,
                    playing video games, and learning something new.  Some video games
                    I play range from PC gaming to console gaming.  Some PC games 
                    I currently play include League of Legends and Counter-Strike.
                    Whereas console games, they range from Street Fighter to Call
                    of Duty to even Grand Theft Auto.  As I progress towards my degree,
                    I want to either become a video game developer or work towards an emphasis 
                    in embedded systems.  I am however, open to other Computer Science
                    electives.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #994C00">Who/What got you into computers?</h2>
                <p>When it comes to computers and technology, my dad has played a
                    major role.  My dad is an integrated test engineer and would always
                    introduce me to new technology.  Not to long ago, he took me to his
                    work place and gave me a tour.  I was fascinated and overwhelmed by
                    everything that was going on.  Machines everywhere! Source codes
                    everywhere!  In other words, I want to be like my father but in a more
                    different way.  Instead of testing the machines, I want to communicate
                    with the machines.  Hence, computer science!</p>
